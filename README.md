# Just Enough Unix!
## including that for the HBS compute grid

The name says it all... An HBS Brown Bag Series seminar

**Summary**<br>
Find Unix tough to learn or confusing? Looking to learn enough to get your work
done while making life less painful? Or do you secretly want to boast to your
friends? This concise class will go through the basics of working with files &
navigating directories, handling large numbers of files, customizing your
environment to work more efficiently, and interacting with the HBS compute grid
resources. 

This will enable you to do complex things with just a few keystrokes, help you combine existing programs in new ways, and automate repetitive tasks so they arenâ€™t typing the same things over and over again!


**Installation Instructions**<br>
Not painful for Mac and Linux users. A bit more involved for PC users.
Please see our [Installation Instructions](installation.md) document.

**Nota Bene!** Windows 10 users, like Mac OS users, now get to enjoy both a rich GUI interface for typical work, and a Unix environment under the hood. Unix Subsystem for Windows 10 can be installed and used for most of the commands we showcase here. Please see these pages: [MS DevNet Unix on Windows documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) and How-To Geek's Window's 10 New Bash](https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/).
