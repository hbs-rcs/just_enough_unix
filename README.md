# Just Enough Unix!
## including that for the HBS compute grid

The name says it all... An HBS Brown Bag Series seminar

**Summary**
Find Unix tough to learn or confusing? Looking to learn enough to get your work
done while making life less painful? Or do you secretly want to boast to your
friends? This concise class will go through the basics of working with files &
navigating directories, handling large numbers of files, customizing your
environment to work more efficiently, and interacting with the HBS compute grid
resources.

**Installation Instructions**
Not painful for Mac and Linux users. A bit more involved for PC users.
Please see our [Installation Instructions](installation.md) document.
