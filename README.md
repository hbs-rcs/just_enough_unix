# Just Enough Unix!
## Including Unix for the HBS Compute Grid

The name says it all... An HBS Lunch-and-Learn Series seminar

### Summary
Find Unix tough to learn or confusing? Looking to learn enough to get your work
done while making life less painful? Or do you secretly want to boast to your
friends? This concise class will go through the basics of working with files &
navigating directories, handling large numbers of files, customizing your
environment to work more efficiently, and interacting with the HBS compute grid
resources. 

This class will enable you to do complex things with just a few keystrokes, help you combine existing programs in new ways, and automate repetitive tasks so they arenâ€™t typing the same things over and over again!


### Objectives

At the conclusion of this seminar, we hope that you will be familiar and more confident
with the following Unix concepts and methods
* Format of a Unix command, types of output, and how to get help
* Understand the structure of and how to traverse the filesystem 
* Know how to create & remove files & directories 
* Know how to copy/move files & directories 
* How to view the contents of files, how to find content inside files, and files themselves
* Commands for transferring files and handling large numbers of files
* One way to customize your work environment
* Common Unix commands for the LSF scheduler on the HBS Comput Grid


### Installation Instructions
